= UI

== Page frame

- Use toasts to indicate server errors and other messages?
  - see [toasty-bootstrap(https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/andrewjackman/toasty-bootstrap/latest/)
    - tests failing as of 20181230, but seems to be CI config issue (missing elm.json; the demo
      is working nicely)

== Info page

- link from '# of xxx (containers)' to container list with that particular filter applied?

== Container list

- show run state in color
- sort by date?
- allow filtering by name (and other columns?)


== Charts

- Pie chart (or similar): containers by size
- Pie chart (or similar): images by size
